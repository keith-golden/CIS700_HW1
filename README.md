# CIS700_HW1
First assignment for CIS 700 - Interactive Fiction and Text Generation

In my game, the player is a scientist operating in a research base in Antarctica. The scientist is exhausted and needs to unwind. Fortunately, the research base is built over a thermal vent that provides heat to an indoor pool where the player can relax. The objective of the game is to gain access to the pool.

I chose the setting of a research lab in Antarctica for two reasons. First, I've loved this setting ever since seeing the 1982 movie, The Thing. The environment is remote, brutal, and eerie, which adds to the suspense of any story. There's also the interesting juxtaposition of the barren nothingness of Antarctica and the state-of-the-art technology inside the research base. Secondly, given that our game environments are supposed to be relatively simple, I thought the setting of an Antarctic research lab would be fitting -- the environment outside could be ignored, and the research base could be as simple or complex as I wanted. My decision for the objective was random -- I just thought it would be nice and relaxing to have a heated pool in Antarctica.
